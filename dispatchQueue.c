Creates a dispatch queue, probably setting up any associated threads and a linked list to be used by
the added tasks. The queueType is either CONCURRENT or SERIAL.
Returns: A pointer to the created dispatch queue.
Example:
dispatch_queue_t *queue;

Destroys the dispatch queue queue. All allocated memory and resources such as semaphores are

Creates a task. work is the function to be called when the task is executed, param is a pointer to
either a structure which holds all of the parameters for the work function to execute with or a single
parameter which the work function uses. If it is a single parameter it must either be a pointer or
something which can be cast to or from a pointer. The name is a string of up to 63 characters. This
is useful for debugging purposes.
Returns: A pointer to the created task.
Example:
void do_something(void *param) {
long value = (long)param;
printf(“The task was passed the value %ld.\n”, value);
}
task_t *task;
task = task_create(do_something, (void *)42, “do_something”);

Executes the work function number of times (in parallel if the queue is CONCURRENT). Each
